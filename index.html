    <h2>Research Interests & Personal Statement</h2>

    <p><strong>Passion for 3D Vision</strong>: I have developed a strong interest and solid foundation in 3D computer vision, especially in point cloud understanding, reconstruction, and perception under complex scenarios. Through multiple research internships at top-tier labs, I have worked on transparent object reconstruction for CVPR submission and radar-based human center estimation—both requiring deep technical insight and persistent experimentation.</p>

    <p><strong>Self-driven and Execution-oriented</strong>: I am highly self-driven and results-oriented: I independently led an innovation project, contributed actively to algorithm optimization in research teams, and continuously improved through hands-on engineering. I deeply value lifelong learning and independent thinking, which motivate me to dive into unfamiliar frameworks, explore state-of-the-art techniques, and adapt quickly to new challenges.</p>

    <p><strong>Vision for AI Solutions</strong>: My long-term goal is to become a solution architect who bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and real-world applications, particularly in perception-driven systems. I look forward to expanding my expertise into broader AI deployment frameworks such as Multimodal LLMs in the future.</p>
