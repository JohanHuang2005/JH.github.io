  ### Research Experience

  #### Research Internship
  **Peking University, School of Computer Science, Wireless Sensing Group**

  Aug 2024 – Present
  - Used prompt engineering to input 3D point cloud data into Baidu LLM API, proving the model's ability to handle common-sense questions.
  - Digital signals processed with MATLAB for high-precision ranging. Found no significant differences in accuracy between the CZT-FFT combined algorithm and FFT when detecting stable moving objects; suitable for detecting objects with sudden behavioral changes.
  - Applied a lightweight CNN + LSTM network to distinguish indoor objects from point-cloud data, optimizing existing algorithms. Improved detection precision from 94% to more than 99% in distinguishing people, dogs and fans.
  - Addressing low-precision human center estimation using low-cost millimeter-wave radar; solution framework completed and currently under optimization.

  #### Research Internship
  **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Vision Lab**

  Apr 2025 – Present
  - Exploring 3D reconstruction methods for complex transparent objects, targeting submission to CVPR 2026.

  #### Project Leader of Innovation Training Program
  **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**

  Oct 2023 – Jun 2024
  - Led a team in developing a GPS-camera integrated system for high-altitude exploration, resulting in a working prototype that reduced costs for target users.

  ### Projects

  #### Graphical Math Game for UK Students (Java-based)
  - Developed an interactive graphical math learning game for primary school students in the UK.
  - Contributed to system architecture, debugging, Git branch integration, and project report writing.

  #### AI Intro Lab
  - Trained neural networks and performed result analysis.
  - Applied K-means clustering and SVM classification on the Iris dataset.

  - **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C, MATLAB
  - **English Proficiency**: CET-4: 600+, CET-6: 530+
  - **Tools & Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Git, LaTeX

  ### Research Interests & Personal Statement

  **Passion for 3D Vision**: I have developed a strong interest and solid foundation in 3D computer vision, especially in point cloud understanding, reconstruction, and perception under complex scenarios. Through multiple research internships at top-tier labs, I have worked on transparent object reconstruction for CVPR submission and radar-based human center estimation—both requiring deep technical insight and persistent experimentation.

  **Self-driven and Execution-oriented**: I am highly self-driven and results-oriented: I independently led an innovation project, contributed actively to algorithm optimization in research teams, and continuously improved through hands-on engineering. I deeply value lifelong learning and independent thinking, which motivate me to dive into unfamiliar frameworks, explore state-of-the-art techniques, and adapt quickly to new challenges.

  **Vision for AI Solutions**: My long-term goal is to become a solution architect who bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and real-world applications, particularly in perception-driven systems. I look forward to expanding my expertise into broader AI deployment frameworks such as Multimodal LLMs in the future.
